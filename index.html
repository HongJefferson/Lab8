<h1>The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. It includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The size of the entire Universe is unknown.

The earliest scientific models of the Universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at the center of the Universe.<br>
 Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus (1473â€“1543) to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the center of the Solar System.<br>
